The world does things to "break" all of us. A lot of us get stronger at the broken places (in other words, you got a thicker skin after humiliation, or something that used to bug or hurt you no longer does). Those that do not "break" easy (courageous people) have to be killed by the world to be broken (think of Emmitt Till, Pat Tillman, American Sniper's subject, etc.) as well as the very good or gentle (Lincoln, Historical Jesus if he existed, etc.). If you are none of these (cowardly, selfish, neutral or bad natured), the world will eventually get around to killing you in its own good time, but not as urgently as it kills the good and courageous with extreme prejudice.
